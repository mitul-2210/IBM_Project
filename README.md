## 🔍 Objective

To detect fraudulent transactions using:
- ✅ Random Forest (supervised learning)
- ✅ Isolation Forest (unsupervised learning)

---

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- **Hosted on S3**:  
  `https://ibm-project-bucket-19.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/creditcard.csv`

---

## ✅ Steps Completed

### 1. **Model Training**
- Implemented in `fraud_detection.py`
- Trained on 80/20 split of the dataset.
- Saved trained Random Forest model to `random_forest_model.pkl`

### 2. **Model Evaluation**
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, MCC
- Confusion Matrix with Seaborn heatmap

### 3. **Model Packaging**
- Compressed `random_forest_model.pkl` → `model.tar.gz`
- Uploaded to S3:  
  `s3://ibm-project-bucket-19/models/model.tar.gz`

### 4. **Inference Script**
- Wrote `inference.py`:
  - `model_fn()`, `input_fn()`, `predict_fn()`, `output_fn()`
- Used by SageMaker to serve predictions.

### 5. **GitHub Repository**
- All scripts and model uploaded to:  
  [mitul-2210/IBM_Project](https://github.com/mitul-2210/IBM_Project)

### 6. **SageMaker Studio Setup**
- Created SageMaker Studio domain and user profile
- Attached **S3 Full Access policy** to execution role

### 7. **Model Deployment**
- Used `SKLearnModel` to deploy to an endpoint:
  ```python
  predictor = model.deploy(
      instance_type='ml.t2.medium',
      initial_instance_count=1,
      endpoint_name='fraud-detector-sagemaker-1'
  )
````

## 🔎 Inference Example

```python
sample = {
    "Time": 0.0,
    "V1": -1.3598071336738,
    "V2": -0.0727811733098497,
    ...
    "Amount": 149.62
}
response = predictor.predict([sample])
print("Prediction:", response)
```

## 🛠 Requirements

```
scikit-learn==0.23.2
pandas
numpy
seaborn
matplotlib
joblib
```

---

## ✅ Next Steps

* [ ] Confirm working prediction from deployed endpoint
* [ ] Build a frontend/UI for real-time fraud detection
* [ ] Monitor endpoint via CloudWatch
* [ ] Optimize model performance with hyperparameter tuning
