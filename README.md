# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

This project applies Isolation Forest and Random Forest to detect fraudulent transactions using the [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).

## Files
- `fraud_detection.py` - Main script for training and evaluation
- `creditcard.csv` - Dataset (if hosted locally)
- `requirements.txt` - Dependencies list

## How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python fraud_detection.py

## Dataset
Due to file size limits, we do not include `creditcard.csv` here.

Please download it from:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

Place it in the root directory before running the script.
